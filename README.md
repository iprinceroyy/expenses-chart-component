## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
-   See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
-   View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

};
```

### Continued development

I want to refine my web development skills, become more adaptable with different technologies, libraries, and frameworks with the changing world. My main objective is to get involved more & more so that ultimately I can have a good grip of web development.
